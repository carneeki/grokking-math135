\begin{itemize}
  \item POMI establishes that a given statement is true for all $\mathbb{N}$.
  \item Start by proving (or assuming if given) that the first statement is true. This statement is called the \textbf{basis} or \textbf{base case}
  \item Next prove that \textbf{any one} statement then so is the next statement. This is known as the \textbf{inductive step}.
