\section{Polynomial Equations}
\label{sec:P Polynomial Equations}

An equation in the form $ax + b = 0$ where $a,b \in \mathbb{F}$ and $a \neq 0$
is called a \emph{linear equation} or \emph{linear polynomial equation}. It has
a degree of $1$ (that is, the power of $x$ is $1$). We can determine the value
of $x$:

\begin{align}
  ax + b &= 0 \\
  ax &= -b \\
  x &= -\frac{b}{x}
\end{align}

An equation in the form $ax^2 + bx +c = 0$ where $a, b, c \in \mathbb{F}$ are
constants and $a \neq 0$ is called a \emph{quadratic equation}. To solve such an
equation we use the \emph{quadratic formula}:

\begin{align}
  x &= \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 -4ac}}{2a} \label{eq:quadraticFormula}
\end{align}

Where $b^2-4ac$ (called the \emph{determinant}) is greater than or equal to $0$.
This will yield two solutions:
\begin{align}
  x &= \frac{-b + \sqrt{b^2 -4ac}}{2a} \nonumber
\intertext{and}
  x &= \frac{-b - \sqrt{b^2 -4ac}}{2a} \nonumber
\end{align}
However, equation \ref{eq:quadraticFormula} is the most compact and easiest to
remember.

If the determinant < 0, then it indicates there are no roots exist in the
real plane ($\mathbb{R}$) and that a complex plane ($\mathbb{C}$) solution
exists.

For polynomials of degree $3$ or more there is no general formula for a
solution, however division of polynomials allows us to reduce polynomials of a
higher degree to a factor and a lesser degree. By iteratively reducing
polynomials we can eventually find all roots. 
\section{Polynomial Division}

Remember long division from primary school? By the time we get to university
most of us have forgotten. Checkout \url{http://goo.gl/TvDoI} for a Kahn Academy
video on how to do it using just plain numbers. It is well worth the refresher
even if you think you can remember how it works.

There is a simple recursive algorithm for polynomial long division, consisting
of 3 steps which are repeated until either a divide by zero, or a remainder
occurs.

\begin{enumerate}
  \item Divide the next term numerator (the part under the long line) by the
  first term in the denominator. Write the result above the long line.
  \item Multiply the result by the denominator and then by $-1$. Write the
  result underneath the term(s) operated on, underlining any new terms.
  \item Perform a simple addition, carrying anything down below the line.
\end{enumerate}
Rinse and repeat these 3 steps underneath your new long line.

The following example comes from Purple Math, \url{http://goo.gl/GPi0z}:
Suppose we wish to divide $\frac{x^2 -9x -10}{x+1}$:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item First write the polynomial in the form:
  \\ \polylongdiv[stage=1]{x^2 -9x -10}{x+1} \\[0.5cm]
  We will look only at the leading $x$ in the divisor and the leading $x^2$ in
  the numerator. 
  \item We want to divide the $x^2$ in the numerator by the $x$ in the
  denominator. $\frac{x^2}{x} = x$ so we write the resulting $x$ above the line.
  \\ \polylongdiv[stage=2]{x^2 -9x -10}{x+1}
  \item Now we must take care of the $+1$ in the denominator. Multiply the
  result above the line by $-1$ and multiply again by the denominator:
  \\ \polylongdiv[stage=3]{x^2 -9x -10}{x+1}
  \item Perform the subtraction as we would a normal sum carrying anything to
  the right down:
  \\ \polylongdiv[stage=4]{x^2 -9x -10}{x+1}
  \item Divide $-10x -10$ by $x$ goes $-10$ times, so write $-10$ above the line
  \\ \polylongdiv[stage=5]{x^2 -9x -10}{x+1} 
  \item Multiply $-10$ by $-1$ and then again by $(x+1)$:
  \\ \polylongdiv[stage=7]{x^2 -9x -10}{x+1}
  \item \textbf{The zero means there is no remainder, and we are done.}
\end{enumerate}

Another example of polynomial long division, taken from the same site as above,
to divide $\frac{x^2 +9x +14}{x +7}$
\begin{enumerate}
  \item Write out in the standard form:
  \\ \polylongdiv[stage=1]{x^2 +9x +14}{x +7} \\
  \item Next divide $\frac{x^2}{x}=x$ and write above the line.
  \\ \polylongdiv[stage=2]{x^2 +9x +14}{x +7} \\
  \item Multiply $-x$ by $x+7$ and write underneath:
  \\ \polylongdiv[stage=3]{x^2 +9x +14}{x +7} \\
  \item Perform the addition:
  \\ \polylongdiv[stage=4]{x^2 +9x +14}{x +7} \\
  \item Divide $\frac{2x}{x}=2$
  \\ \polylongdiv[stage=5]{x^2 +9x +14}{x +7} \\
  \item Multiply $-2$ by $x+7$ and write underneath, and we can see there is no
  remainder.
  \\ \polylongdiv[stage=7]{x^2 +9x +14}{x +7}
\end{enumerate}
